LH Email enables you to queu your emails so they are sent asynchronously.

== Description ==

If you are sending large volumes of emails this is the plugin you need.

Generally wordpress emails are best sent by a third party, like gmauil or Sendgrid. But connecting and sending a large number of emails to third parties will slow your visitor experience down.

Unless those emails are sent in the background. This plugin does that.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `lh-email-queue` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That is it
